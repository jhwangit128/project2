Cats do not reach full maturity until the age of 3 years, and many love to race and play like kittens all their life. Because of this, please consider all the cats when you are ready to adopt. An adult cat can be the ideal choice if you work all day, or if you wish to adopt a companion for your current pet. Whether you want a mellow lapcat or a bundle of energy, our adoption counselors will help you choose the cat that is right for you.',

You can bring your laptop to do a little work on our free wifi, sign up for our cat yoga sessions, or just sit around with a cat on your lap and play free-play arcade games, there's also Nintendo64 Mario Kart which is a fan favorite. Our hope is that you find a new family member and adopt them into a loving and caring household because all of our cats are vaccinated, spayed or neutered, microchipped, and ready for same-day adoption (pending an application process). If you are not able to adopt that is okay, because just by coming in and visiting you are helping to support our mission of saving cats. The entry fee goes to directly help offset the cost of medical treatment for the cats and operating expenses for the shelter.",
